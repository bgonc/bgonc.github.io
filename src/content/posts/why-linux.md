# The Beginning

I used to use Windows for everything. Gaming, development, browsing. It was fine, but I always felt like I was fighting the OS. Updates at random times, telemetry I couldn't disable, and a terminal that felt like an afterthought (this was before WSL 2 got good).

## The Switch

One day, I decided to install **Ubuntu** on an old laptop. The installation was smoother than I remembered from years ago.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

That simple command felt powerful. I was in control.

## Customization

Then I discovered `dotfiles`. The ability to configure every single aspect of my system via text files was mind-blowing.

I started using **Neovim** and **Tmux**.

```lua
-- My Neovim config snippet
vim.opt.number = true
vim.opt.relativenumber = true
```

## Conclusion

Linux isn't just an OS; it's a philosophy. It respects your freedom and encourages you to understand how your computer works.
